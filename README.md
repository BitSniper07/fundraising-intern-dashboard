# fundraising-intern-dashboard
The Fundraising Intern Dashboard is a sleek and interactive web-based interface designed specifically for interns working in fundraising roles. It provides a centralized space for interns to view and manage their personal details, track performance metrics, review recent activities, and stay updated — all through a user-friendly and visually engaging UI.

This project was created as part of an internship assignment to demonstrate skills in frontend development using modern web technologies like HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. The dashboard is responsive, mobile-friendly, and includes features like dark mode, animated elements, and interactive buttons to enhance usability and design appeal.
